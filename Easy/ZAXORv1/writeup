WRITEUP - svidnet's ZEXOR-v1(Linux version)

Firstly :

With file ZEXORv1_wayland I can know that is a ELF 64 bits file, not stripped
Now I can do a : strings ZEXORv1_wayland
I actually find the licence key : AEXORRBSHA36325S33

It's not fun anymore, let's try to patch it to put whatever licence key.
I can see some functions calls like strcmp() who's a string comparison, gtk_entry_get_text()
So nothing complicated, juste to modify the comparison.

Patching the License Check (IDA)

I open the binary in IDA and navigate to the function responsible for validating the license key.

By following the call to strcmp(), I identify the comparison between the user input and the hardcoded license key.
Immediately after this comparison, the result is tested and a conditional jump is performed:

test    eax, eax
jz      loc_1460


The jz instruction is taken when the comparison succeeds. To bypass this verification and allow any license key, I patch the conditional jump.

I replace the jz instruction with nop instructions of equivalent size:

nop


This effectively removes the conditional check, forcing the program to continue execution as if the license key were always valid.

Finally, I apply the patch by selecting:

Easy
